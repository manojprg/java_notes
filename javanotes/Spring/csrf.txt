CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It's a type of attack where a malicious website tricks a user's browser
 into making unintended requests to a different website where the user is authenticated. 
 The attacker aims to perform actions on behalf of the victim without their consent or knowledge.

Here's how a CSRF attack typically works:

1. The victim visits a malicious website while authenticated to a legitimate website 
(such as an online banking site, social media platform, or webmail service). The malicious website contains hidden 
code or scripts that generate requests to the legitimate website.

2. When the victim visits the malicious site, their browser automatically sends requests (e.g., to transfer money, 
change account settings, etc.) to the legitimate site without their knowledge.

3. Since the victim is already authenticated to the legitimate site (e.g., via cookies), the site may mistakenly 
interpret these requests as legitimate actions initiated by the user.

To prevent CSRF attacks, web developers can implement various security measures:

1. **CSRF Tokens**: Include unique tokens in each form or request that only the server knows how to validate. 
These tokens are typically included in forms or headers and must be sent with each request. The server validates 
the token to ensure that the request originated from the intended source.

2. **SameSite Cookies**: Set the `SameSite` attribute on cookies to restrict when they are sent. By setting cookies as 
`SameSite=Strict` or `SameSite=Lax`, you can prevent them from being sent in cross-origin requests, thus mitigating CSRF attacks.

3. **Origin Headers**: Verify the `Origin` header on incoming requests to ensure they originate from an expected domain. 
This helps prevent requests from unexpected sources.

4. **Custom Headers**: Include custom headers in requests and validate them on the server side. Since browsers automatically 
include certain headers in cross-origin requests, including custom headers can help differentiate between legitimate and forged requests.

5. **Referrer Policy**: Set a strict referrer policy to control which URLs are included in the `Referer` header of outgoing requests. 
This can help prevent leakage of sensitive information to malicious sites.

By implementing these security measures, web developers can significantly reduce the risk of CSRF attacks and protect users' 
sensitive data and actions on their websites.
