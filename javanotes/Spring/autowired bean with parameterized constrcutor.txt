I am not able to autowire a bean while passing values in paramterized constructor.

How to call the parameterized constructor using SpringBoot?

@Component
public class MainClass {

    public void someTask() {
        AnotherClass obj = new AnotherClass(1, 2);
    }

}
//Replace the new AnotherClass(1, 2) using Autowire?

@Component
public class AnotherClass {
    private int number,age;

    public AnotherClass(int number, int age) {
        super();
        this.number = number;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

Answer:
===========================

You need to specify this bean in the constructor:

@Component
public class MainClass {

    private final AnotherClass anotherClass;

    // this annotation is NOT required if there is only 1 constructor, shown for clarity.
    @Autowired
    MainClass(AnotherClass anotherClass) {
        this.anotherClass = anotherClass;
    }
    public void someTask() {
        // anotherClass is already instantiated by the time you get here.
    }


}
Option 1: Directly allow AnotherClass to be created with a component scan.

Now, in order for Spring to be able to construct AnotherClass as a bean, you need to 
tell it in a 'Spring way' about where it gets it's values from:

@Component
public class AnotherClass {
    private final int number,age;

    // also not needed if this is the only constructor.
    @Autowired
    public AnotherClass(
// @Value is a spring annotation to provide spring the value it needs for this parameter.
                        @Value("${property.number:0}") int number, 
                        @Value("${property.age:0}") int age) {
        this.number = number;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
What this is doing, is pulling 2 properties, property.number and property.age from application.properties
|application.yml for the value(s) of those integers.

You will need to ensure both of these classes are on the component scan path, or else spring boot won't 
attempt to make beans of these classes.

Option 2: Use a Configuration Class to make the AnotherClass bean

@Configuration
public class MyConfigurationClass {

    @Bean
    public AnotherClass anotherClass {
        return new AnotherClass(1,2)
    }
}
In this example, you would not annotate AnotherClass with @Component.

Option 3: Use a custom factory method as found in this blog.

Again, with this strategy, do not annotate AnotherClass with @Component

@Configuration
public class MyConfigurationClass {

    @Bean
    public BiFunction<Integer, Integer, MyPrototype> myPrototypeFactory() {
        return start, age -> anotherClass(start, age);
    }

    @Bean
    @Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public AnotherClass anotherClass(Integer start, Integer age) {
        if (start == null || age == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("start was: " + start + ", age was: " + age + ". Neither can be null!");
        }
        return new AnotherClass(start,age);
    }
}
Usage:

@Component
public class MainClass {

    private final BiFunction<Integer, Integer, AnotherClass> anotherClassFactory;

    // this annotation is NOT required if there is only 1 constructor, shown for clarity.
    @Autowired
    MainClass(BiFunction<Integer, Integer, AnotherClass> anotherClassFactory) {
        this.anotherClassFactory = anotherClassFactory;
    }
    public void someTask() {
        AnotherClass ac = anotherClassFactory.apply(1,2);
        // do something with your new AnotherClass
    }

}
Option 4: Use ObjectProvider (Since Spring 4.3) as found in this blog post.

Again, with this strategy, do not annotate AnotherClass with @Component

@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
    @Bean
    @Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public AnotherClass createAnotherClass(Integer start, Integer age) {
        return new AnotherClass(start, age);
    }
}
Usage:

@Component
public class MainClass {

    private final ObjectProvider<AnotherClass> anotherClassProvider;

    // this annotation is NOT required if there is only 1 constructor, shown for clarity.
    @Autowired
    MainClass(ObjectProvider<AnotherClass> anotherClassProvider) {
        this.anotherClassProvider = anotherClassProvider;
    }
    public void someTask() {
        // may need to cast the result of '.getObject()'
        AnotherClass ac = anotherClassProvider.getObject(/*start*/ 1, /*age*/ 2);
        // do something with your new AnotherClass
    }

}

ObjectProvider is an interface in Spring Framework that provides a way to obtain instances of beans at runtime, 
allowing for deferred dependency injection. It is useful when you need to obtain a bean in a lazy or conditional way, 
or when you need to obtain multiple instances of a bean.

Here's an example of how to use ObjectProvider in Spring:

@Component
public class MyClass {
    private final ObjectProvider<MyDependency> myDependencyProvider;

    public MyClass(ObjectProvider<MyDependency> myDependencyProvider) {
        this.myDependencyProvider = myDependencyProvider;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        MyDependency myDependency = myDependencyProvider.getObject();
        // use myDependency instance
    }
}

@Component
public class MyDependency {
    // class methods
}
In this example, MyClass has a constructor that takes an ObjectProvider<MyDependency> as a parameter. 
When the doSomething() method is called, the getObject() method is called on the myDependencyProvider 
to obtain an instance of MyDependency.

ObjectProvider can also be used to obtain multiple instances of a bean. Here's an example:

@Component
public class MyClass {
    private final ObjectProvider<MyDependency> myDependencyProvider;

    public MyClass(ObjectProvider<MyDependency> myDependencyProvider) {
        this.myDependencyProvider = myDependencyProvider;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        StreamSupport.stream(myDependencyProvider.spliterator(), false)
            .forEach(myDependency -> {
                // use myDependency instance
            });
    }
}

@Component
public class MyDependency {
    // class methods
}
In this example, the getObject() method is not called directly on the ObjectProvider. 
Instead, the spliterator() method is called to obtain a Spliterator over the instances of MyDependency. 
The StreamSupport.stream() method is then used to create a stream from the Spliterator, and the forEach()
 method is called on the stream to iterate over the instances and use them.

ObjectProvider is a useful interface in Spring when you need to obtain instances of beans at runtime, 
and it allows for greater flexibility in the way that dependencies are injected
