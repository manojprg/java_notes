In Java, PriorityQueue is a class that implements the Queue interface and provides a priority queue data structure. 
It orders elements according to their natural ordering (if they implement Comparable) or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time.

Ordering: Elements are ordered based on their priority. When elements are added to the priority queue, 
they are ordered according to the comparator or natural ordering.

Priority Handling: The element with the highest priority (according to the specified ordering) will be removed 
first when calling methods like poll() or remove().

Efficiency: PriorityQueue is implemented as a priority heap, which allows for efficient 
addition and removal of elements with logarithmic time complexity.

Null Elements: PriorityQueue does not allow null elements.

Iteration Order: The iteration order of elements in a PriorityQueue is not specified and may change if the queue's structure is modified.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of PriorityQueue:

java
Copy code
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a priority queue with integer elements
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();

        // Add elements to the priority queue
        pq.add(5);
        pq.add(3);
        pq.add(8);
        pq.add(1);

        // Print and remove elements from the priority queue
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println(pq.poll()); // Outputs: 1, 3, 5, 8
        }
    }
}
